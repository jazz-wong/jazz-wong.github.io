        The damp path zigzagged like those of my childhood. When we reached the
        house, we went into a library filled with books from both East and West.
        I recognized some large volumes bound in yellow silk-manuscripts of the
        Lost Encyclopedia which was edited by the Third Emperor of the Luminous
        Dynasty. They had never been printed. A phonograph record was spinning
        near a bronze phoenix. I remember also a rose-glazed jar and yet
        another, older by many centuries, of that blue color which our potters
        copied from the Persiansâ€¦<br /><br />

        Stephen Albert was watching me with a smile on his face. He was, as I
        have said, remarkably tall. His face was deeply lined and he had gray
        eyes and a gray beard. There was about him something of the priest, and
        something of the sailor. Later, he told me he had been a missionary in
        Tientsin before he "had aspired to become a Sinologist."<br /><br />

        We sat down, I upon a large, low divan, he with his back to the window
        and to a large circular clock. I calculated that my pursuer, Richard
        Madden, could not arrive in less than an hour. My irrevocable decision
        could wait. </p> <br><br><br><br>

        "A strange destiny," said Stephen Albert, "that of Ts'ui Pen - Governor
        of his native province, learned in astronomy, in astrology and tireless
        in the interpretation of the canonical books, a chess player, a famous
        poet and a calligrapher. Yet he abandoned all to make a book and a
        labyrinth. He gave up all the pleasures of oppression, justice, of a
        well-stocked bed, of banquets, and even of erudition, and shut himself
        up in the Pavilion of the Limpid Sun for thirteen years. At his death,
        his heirs found only a mess of manuscripts. The family, as you doubtless
        know, wished to consign them to the fire, but the executor of the estate
        - a Taoist or a Buddhist monk - insisted on their publication."<br /><br />

        "Those of the blood of Ts'ui Pen," I replied, "still curse the memory of
        that monk. Such a publication was madness. The book is a shapeless mass
        of contradictory rough drafts. I examined it once upon a time: the hero
        dies in the third chapter, while in the fourth he is alive. As for that
        other enterprise of Ts'ui Pen ... his Labyrinth..."<br /><br />

        "Here is the Labyrinth," Albert said, pointing to a tall, laquered
        writing cabinet.<br /><br />

        "An ivory labyrinth?" I exclaimed. "A tiny labyrinth indeed...!"<br /><br />

        "A symbolic labyrinth," he corrected me. "An invisible labyrinth of
        time. I, a barbarous Englishman, have been given the key to this
        transparent mystery. After more than a hundred years most of the details
        are irrecoverable, lost beyond all recall, but it isn't hard to image
        what must have happened. At one time, Ts'ui Pen must have said; 'I am
        going into seclusion to write a book,' and at another, 'I am retiring to
        construct a maze.' Everyone assumed these were separate activities. No
        one realized that the book and the labyrinth were one and the same. The
        Pavilion of the Limpid Sun was set in the middle of an intricate garden.
        This may have suggested the idea of a physical maze.<br /><br />

        "Ts'ui Pen died. In all the vast lands which once belonged to your
        family, no one could find the labyrinth. The novel's confusion suggested
        that it was the labyrinth. Two circumstances showed me the direct
        solution to the problem. First, the curious legend that Ts'ui Pen had
        proposed to create an infinite maze, second, a fragment of a letter
        which I discovered."
