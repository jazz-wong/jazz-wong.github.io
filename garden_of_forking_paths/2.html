    <h1>Two O'Clock</h1>
    <div class="text2">
        
    <p>
        I carried out my plan because I felt the Chief had some fear of those of
        my race, of those uncountable forebears whose culmination lies in me. I
        wished to prove to him that a yellow man could save his armies. Besides,
        I had to escape the Captain. His hands and voice could, at any moment,
        knock and beckon at my door. <br><br>

        Silently, I dressed, took leave of myself in the mirror, went down the
        stairs, sneaked a look at the quiet street, and went out. The station
        was not far from my house, but I thought it more prudent to take a cab.
        I told myself that I thus ran less chance of being recognized. The truth
        is that, in the deserted street, I felt infinitely visible and
        vulnerable. I recall that I told the driver to stop short of the main
        entrance. I got out with a painful and deliberate slowness.<br><br>

        I was going to the village of Ashgrove, but took a ticket for a station
        further on. The train would leave in a few minutes, at eight-fifty. I
        hurried, for the next would not go until half past nine. There was
        almost no one on the platform. I walked through the carriages. I
        remember some farmers, a woman dressed in mourning, a youth deep in
        Tacitus' Annals and a wounded, happy soldier.<br><br>

        At last the train pulled out. A man I recognized ran furiously, but
        vainly, the length of the platform. It was Captain Richard Madden.
        Shattered, trembling, I huddled in the distant corner of the seat, as
        far as possible from the fearful window.<br><br>

        From utter terror I passed into a state of almost abject happiness. I
        told myself that the duel had already started and that I had won the
        first encounter by besting my adversary in his first attack - even if it
        was only for forty minutes - by an accident of fate. I argued that so
        small a victory prefigured a total victory. I argued that it was not so
        trivial, that were it not for the precious accident of the train
        schedule, I would be in prison or dead. I argued, with no less sophism,
        that my timorous happiness was proof that I was man enough to bring this
        adventure to a successful conclusion. From my weakness I drew strength
        that never left me.<br><br>

        I foresee that man will resign himself each day to new abominations,
        that soon only soldiers and bandits will be left. To them I offer this
        advice: Whosoever would undertake some atrocious enterprise should act
        as if it were already accomplished, should impose upon himself a future
        as irrevocable as the past. <br><br>
        
        Thus I proceeded, while with the eyes of a man already dead, I
        contemplated the fluctuations of the day which would probably be my
        last, and watched the diffuse coming of night.
