        The train crept along gently, amid ash trees. It slowed down and
        stopped, almost in the middle of a field. No one called the name of a
        station. "Ashgrove?" I asked some children on the platform. "Ashgrove,"
        they replied. I got out. <br /><br />

        A lamp lit the platform, but the children's faces remained in a shadow.
        One of them asked me: "Are you going to Dr. Stephen Albert's house?"
        Without waiting for my answer, another said: "The house is a good
        distance away but you won't get lost if you take the road to the left
        and bear to the left at every crossroad." I threw them a coin (my last),
        went down some stone steps and started along a deserted road. At a
        slight incline, the road ran downhill. It was a plain dirt way, and
        overhead the branches of trees intermingled, while a round moon hung low
        in the sky as if to keep me company. </p>

        <p>For a moment I thought that Richard Madden might in some way have
        divined my desperate intent. At once I realized that this would be
        impossible. The advice about turning always to the left reminded me that
        such was the common formula for finding the central courtyard of certain
        labyrinths. I know something about labyrinths. Not for nothing am I the
        greatgrandson of Ts'ui Pen. He was Governor of Yunnan and gave up
        temporal power to write a novel with more characters than there are in
        the Hung Lou Meng, and to create a maze in which all men would lose
        themselves. He spent thirteen years on these oddly assorted tasks before
        he was assassinated by a stranger. His novel had no sense to it and
        nobody ever found his labyrinth. <br /><br />

        Under the trees of England I meditated on this lost and perhaps mythical
        labyrinth. I imagined it untouched and perfect on the secret summit of
        some mountain; I imagined it drowned under rice paddies or beneath the
        sea; I imagined it infinite, made not only of eight-sided pavilions and
        of twisting paths but also of rivers, provinces and kingdoms ... I
        thought of a maze of mazes, of a sinuous, ever growing maze which would
        take in both past and future and would somehow involve the stars.
        <br /><br />

        Lost in these imaginary illusions I forgot my destiny - that of the
        hunted. For an undetermined period of time I felt myself cut off from
        the world, an abstract spectator. The hazy and murmuring countryside,
        the moon, the decline of the evening, stirred within me. Going down the
        gently sloping road I could not feel fatigue. The evening was at once
        intimate and infinite.
