    <h1>One O'Clock</h1>
    <p>
        In the midst of my hatred and terror (now that it no longer matters to
        me to speak of terror, now that I have outwitted Richard Madden, now
        that my neck hankers for the hangman's noose), I knew that the
        fast-moving and doubtless happy soldier did not suspect that I possessed
        the Secret - the name of the exact site of the new British artillery
        park on the Ancre. A bird streaked across the misty sky and, absently, I
        turned it into an airplane and then that airplane into many in the skies
        of France, shattering the artillery park under a rain of bombs. If only
        my mouth, before it should be silenced by a bullet, could shout this
        name in such a way that it could be heard in Germany... My voice, my
        human voice, was weak. How could it reach the ear of the Chief? The ear
        of that sick and hateful man who knew nothing of Runeberg or of me
        except that we were in Staffordshire. A man who, sitting in his arid
        Berlin office, leafed infinitely through newspapers, looking in vain for
        news from us. I said aloud, "I must flee." <br /><br />

        I sat up on the bed, in senseless and perfect silence, as if Madden was
        already peering at me. Something - perhaps merely a desire to prove my
        total penury to myself - made me empty out my pockets. I found just what
        I knew I was going to find. The American watch, the nickel-plated chain
        and the square coin, the key ring with the useless but compromising keys
        to Runeberg's office, the notebook, a letter which I decided to destroy
        at once (and which I did not destroy), a five shilling piece, two single
        shillings and some pennies, a red and blue pencil, a handkerchief - and
        a revolver with a single bullet. Absurdly I held it and weighed it in my
        hand, to give myself courage. Vaguely I thought that a pistol shot can
        be heard for a great distance. <br /><br />

        In ten minutes I had developed my plan. The telephone directory gave me
        the name of the one person capable of passing on the information. He
        lived in a suburb of Fenton, less than half an hour away by train.
        <br /><br />

        I am a timorous man. I can say it now, now that I have brought my
        incredibly risky plan to an end. It was not easy to bring about, and I
        know that its execution was terrible. I did not do it for Germany - no!
        Such a barbarous country is of no importance to me, particularly since
        it had degraded me by making me become a spy. Furthermore, I knew an
        Englishman - a modest man - who, for me, is as great as Goethe. I did
        not speak with him for more than an hour, but during that time, he was
        Goethe.
