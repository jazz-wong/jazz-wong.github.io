        "Fang, let us say, has a secret. A stranger knocks at his door. Fang
        makes up his mind to kill him. Naturally there are various possible
        outcomes. Fang can kill the intruder, the intruder can kill Fang, both
        can be saved, both can die and so on and so on. In Ts'ui Pen's work, all
        the possible solutions occur, each one being the point of departure for
        other bifurcations. Sometimes the pathways of this labyrinth converge.
        For example, you come to this house; but in other possible pasts you are
        my enemy; in others my friend. <br /><br />

        "If you will put up with my atrocious pronunciation, I would like to
        read you a few pages of your ancestor's work."<br /><br />

        His countenance, in the bright circle of lamplight, was certainly that
        of an ancient, but it shone with something unyielding, even immortal.<br /><br />

        With slow precision, he read two versions of the same epic chapter. In
        the first, an army marches into battle over a desolate mountain pass.
        The bleak and somber aspect of the rocky landscape made the soldiers
        feel that life itself was of little value, and so they won the battle
        easily. In the second, the same army passes through a palace where a
        banquet is in progress. The splendor of the feast remained a memory
        throughout the glorious battle, and so victory followed.<br /><br />

        With proper veneration I listened to these old tales, although perhaps
        with less admiration for them in themselves than for the fact that they
        had been thought out by one of my own blood, and that a man of a distant
        empire had given them back to me, in the last stage of a desperate
        adventure, on a Western island. I remember the final words, repeated at
        the end of each version like a secret command: "Thus the heroes fought,
        with tranquil heart and bloody sword. They were resigned to killing and
        to dying."
