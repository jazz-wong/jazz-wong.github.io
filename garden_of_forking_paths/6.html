        Albert rose. For a few moments he turned his back to me. He opened the
        top drawer in the high black and gilded writing cabinet. He returned
        holding in his hand a piece of paper which had once been crimson but
        which had faded with the passage of time: it was rose colored, tenuous,
        quadrangular. Ts'ui Pen's calligraphy was justly famous. Eagerly, but
        without understanding, I read the words which a man of my own blood had
        written with a small brush: "I leave to various future times, but not to
        all, my garden of forking paths."<br /><br/>

        I handed back the sheet of paper in silence. Albert went on:<br /><br />

        "Before I discovered this letter, I kept asking myself how a book could
        be infinite. I could not imagine any other than a cyclic volume,
        circular. A volume whose last page would be the same as the first and so
        have the possibility of continuing indefinitely. I recalled, too, the
        night in the middle of The Thousand and One Nights when Queen
        Scheherezade, through a magical mistake on the part of her copyist,
        started to tell the story of The Thousand and One Nights, with the risk
        of again arriving at the night upon which she will relate it, and thus
        on to infinity. I also imagined a Platonic hereditary work, passed on
        from father to son, to which each individual would add a new chapter or
        correct, with pious care, the work of his elders.<br /><br />

        "These conjectures gave me amusement, but none seemed to have the
        remotest application to the contradictory chapters of Ts'ui Pen. At this
        point, I was sent from Oxford the manuscript you have just seen.<br /><br />

        "Naturally, my attention was caught by the sentence, 'I leave to various
        future times, but not to all, my garden of forking paths: I had no
        sooner read this, than I understood. The Garden of Forking Paths was the
        chaotic novel itself. The phrase 'to various future times, but not to
        all' suggested the image of bifurcating in time, not in space. Rereading
        the whole work confirmed this theory. In all fiction, when a man is
        faced with alternatives he chooses one at the expense of the others. In
        the almost unfathomable Ts'ui Pen, he chooses - simultaneously - all of
        them. He thus creates various futures, various times which start others
        that will in their turn branch out and bifurcate in other times. This is
        the cause of the contradictions in the novel.<br /><br />
