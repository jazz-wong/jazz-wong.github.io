        Albert rose from his seat. He stood up tall as he opened the top drawer
        of the high writing cabinet. For a moment his back was again turned to
        me. I had the revolver ready. I fired with the utmost care: Albert fell
        without a murmur, at once. I swear that his death was instantaneous, as
        if he had been struck by lightning.<br /><br />

        What remains is unreal and unimportant. Madden broke in and arrested me.
        I have been condemned to hang. Abominably, I have yet triumphed! The
        secret name of the city to be attacked got through to Berlin. Yesterday
        it was bombed. I read the news in the same English newspapers which were
        trying to solve the riddle of the murder of the learned Sinologist
        Stephen Albert by the unknown Yu Tsun. The Chief, however, had already
        solved this mystery. He knew that my problem was to shout, with my
        feeble voice, above the tumult of war, the name of the city called
        Albert, and that I had no other course open to me than to kill someone
        of that name. He does not know, for no one can, of my infinite penitence
        and sickness of the heart.<br /><br />

        <p>A malicious and outlandish statement. In point of fact, Captain Richard
    Madden had been attacked by the Prussian spy Hans Rabener, alias Viktor
    Runeberg, who drew an automatic pistol when Madden appeared with orders
    for the spy's arrest. Madden, in self defense, had inflicted wounds of
    which the spy later died. <br><br> - Note by the manuscript editor.</p>
