    <h1>Four O'Clock</h1>
    <div class="text4">
    <p>
        The road kept descending and branching off, through meadows misty in the
        twilight. A high-pitched and almost syllabic music kept coming and
        going, moving with the breeze, blurred by the leaves and by distance.
        <br /><br />

        I thought that a man might be an enemy of other men, of the differing
        moments of other men, but never an enemy of a country: not of fireflies,
        words, gardens, streams, or the West wind.<br /><br /> </p>

        <p>Meditating thus I arrived at a high, rusty iron gate. Through the
        railings I could see an avenue bordered with poplar trees and also a
        kind of summer house or pavilion. Two things dawned on me at once, the
        first trivial and the second almost incredible: the music came from the
        pavilion and that music was Chinese. That was why I had accepted it
        fully, without paying it any attention. I do not remember whether there
        was a bell, a push-button, or whether I attracted attention by clapping
        my hands. The stuttering sparks of the music kept on. <br /><br />

        But from the end of the avenue, from the main house, a lantern
        approached; a lantern which alternately, from moment to moment, was
        crisscrossed or put out by the trunks of the trees; a paper lantern
        shaped like a drum and colored like the moon. A tall man carried it. I
        could not see his face for the light blinded me. <br /><br />

        He opened the gate and spoke slowly in my language.<br /><br />

        "I see that the worthy Hsi P'eng has troubled himself to see to
        relieving my solitude. No doubt you want to see the garden?"<br /><br />

        Recognizing the name of one of our consuls, I replied, somewhat taken
        aback.<br /><br />

        "The garden?"<br /><br />

        "The garden of forking paths."<br /><br />

        Something stirred in my memory and I said, with incomprehensible
        assurance:<br /><br />

        "The garden of my ancestor, Ts'ui Pen."<br /><br />

        "Your ancestor? Your illustrious ancestor? Come in."
