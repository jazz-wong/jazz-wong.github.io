        "In all of them," I enunciated, with a tremor in my voice. "I deeply
        appreciate and am grateful to you for the restoration of Ts'ui Pen's
        garden."<br /><br />

        "Not in all," he murmured with a smile. "Time is forever dividing itself
        toward innumerable futures and in one of them I am your enemy."<br /><br />

        Once again I sensed the pullulation of which I have already spoken. It
        seemed to me that the dew-damp garden surrounding the house was
        infinitely saturated with invisible people. All were Albert and myself,
        secretive, busy and multiform in other dimensions of time. I lifted my
        eyes and the short nightmare disappeared. In the black and yellow garden
        there was only a single man, but this man was as strong as a statue and
        this man was walking up the path and he was Captain Richard Madden.<br /><br />

        "The future exists now," I replied. "But I am your friend. Can I take
        another look at the letter?"<br /><br />
