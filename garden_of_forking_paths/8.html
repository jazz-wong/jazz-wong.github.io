        <p>At that moment I felt within me and around me something invisible and
        intangible pullulating. It was not the pullulation of two divergent,
        parallel, and finally converging armies, but an agitation more
        inaccessible, more intimate, prefigured by them in some way. Stephen
        Albert continued:

        <p>"I do not think that your illustrious ancestor toyed idly with
        variations. I do not find it believable that he would waste thirteen
        years laboring over a never ending experiment in rhetoric. In your
        country the novel is an inferior genre; in Ts'ui Pen's period, it was a
        despised one. Ts'ui Pen was a fine novelist but he was also a man of
        letters who, doubtless, considered himself more than a mere novelist.
        The testimony of his contemporaries attests to this, and certainly the
        known facts of his life confirm his leanings toward the metaphysical and
        the mystical. Philosophical conjectures take up the greater part of his
        novel. I know that of all problems, none disquieted him more, and none
        concerned him more than the profound one of time. Now then, this is the
        only problem that does not figure in the pages of The Garden. He does
        not even use the word which means time. How can these voluntary
        omissions be explained?"<br /><br />

        I proposed various solutions, all of them inadequate. We discussed them.
        Finally Stephen Albert said: "In a guessing game to which the answer is
        chess, which word is the only one prohibited?" I thought for a moment
        and then replied:<br /><br />

        "The word is chess." </p> </div>
