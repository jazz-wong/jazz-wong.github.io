            <p>To Victoria Ocampo <br><br>
            
            In his A History of the World War (page 212), Captain Liddell Hart
            reports that a planned offensive by thirteen British divisions,
            supported by fourteen hundred artillery pieces, against the German line
            at Serre-Montauban, scheduled for July 24, 1916, had to be postponed
            until the morning of the 29th. He comments that torrential rain caused
            this delay - which lacked any special significance. The following
            deposition, dictated by, read over, and then signed by Dr. Yu Tsun,
            former teacher of English at the Tsingtao Hochschule, casts unsuspected
            light upon this event. The first two pages are missing.

            <p> ... and I hung up the phone. Immediately I recollected the voice
                that had spoken in German. It was that of Captain Richard Madden.
                Madden, in Viktor Runeberg's office, meant the end of all our work and -
                though this seemed a secondary matter, or should have seemed so to me -
                of our lives also. His being there meant that Runeberg had been arrested
                or murdered. 1 Before the sun set on this same day, I ran the same risk.
                Madden was implacable. Rather, to be more accurate, he was obliged to be
                implacable. An Irishman in the service of England, a man suspected of
                equivocal feelings if not of actual treachery, how could he fail to
                welcome and seize upon this extraordinary piece of luck: the discovery,
                capture and perhaps the deaths of two agents of Imperial Germany? <br><br>
        
                I went up to my bedroom. Absurd though the gesture was, I closed and
                locked the door. I threw myself down on my narrow iron bed, and waited
                on my back. The never changing rooftops filled the window, and the hazy
                six o'clock sun hung in the sky. It seemed incredible that this day, a
                day without warnings or omens, might be that of my implacable death. In
                despite of my dead father, in despite of having been a child in one of
                the symmetrical gardens of Hai Feng, was I to die now? <br><br>
        
                Then I reflected that all things happen, happen to one, precisely now.
                Century follows century, and things happen only in the present. There
                are countless men in the air, on land and at sea, and all that really
                happens happens to me... The almost unbearable memory of Madden's long 
                horseface put an end to these wandering thoughts.
