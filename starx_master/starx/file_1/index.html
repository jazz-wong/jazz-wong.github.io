      <h1>ONEIRONAUNTS</h1>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Oneironauts are a species of aliens who inhabit the subconscious through
        their own dreams. As of now, it is unknown how these subspaces are
        created or the extent of its power and ability. They survive through
        three hour periods of sleep walking, in which the body performs
        necessary functions, like consumption and excrement. While in their
        dream-states, Oneironauts simply stand or sit, completely stiff and
        frozen. This is especially easy with Luna's icy cold tempertures within
        its mantle. Not too much is known about these creatures, as their
        habitat is too deep for any of S.T.A.R.X's technology to dig deep
        enough. However due to the STARMAN incident of April 1990, the Xenology
        department has been able to capture one. Though, contact has been slim
        due to its current hostage.

      <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
      <p>
        More data needs to be conducted in order to to foster any thesis.
        However, the latest research update on the moon's layers must be
        reanalyzed. However, the Darkening may have answers to when Oneironaunts
        appear closer to the surface of Luna. There is also the "fight" or
        "flight" response theory needed to be tested.

      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>
        X has not made successful contact yet.<br /><br />
        <s>Double the dosage.</s><br />Increase dosage 3-fold. X should be able
        to withstand it. <br /><br />Check vitals for the Oneironaunt hostage.
