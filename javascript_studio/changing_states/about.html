    <p>Five decades ago, Arthur Aron and Elaine Spaulding, a pair of psychology students at the University of California at Berkeley, shared a kiss one day in front of the main study hall and immediately fell in love. The experience led to a mutual fascination not only with each other (they’re still together and now married), but also with the mysteries of love itself. At the time, Aron was looking for a subject on which to base a research project and thought, Why not do a study on romantic love? With help from fellow researchers, including Elaine, he set out on a journey that led him to try to answer this question: How might we, in a laboratory setting, find a way to create instant intimacy between strangers?
        <br><br>
        He brought pairs of strangers into his campus lab and tried to get them to like, or possibly even love, each other. Gradually, Aron discovered a powerful force that seemed able to produce the desired effect: not a love potion, but a well-crafted and strategically designed series of questions. Aron would give a list of the same questions to each member of the participating pairs. The partners would then take turns asking each other the questions and responding.
        <br><br>
        Some questions were more effective than others. Through trial and error, Aron was able to determine the ones that best helped participants share personal information and gradually begin to feel a greater mutual appreciation. He eventually came up with 36 questions, to be used sequentially.
        <br><br>
        The list began with more superficial queries and then built to much more personal questions probing deep feelings about hopes, regrets, dreams, core values. When trying to build a connection with another person, Aron discovered, “you don’t want to share too much, too fast. What works best is back-and-forth self-disclosure that increases gradually.”
        <br><br>
        When people questioned each other in this way, the results were surprising—even to Aron. Most of the pairs of strangers came out of the session with highly positive feelings for each other; one couple later married. Aron’s research, and his 36 questions, gradually began to gain notoriety in the science world.
