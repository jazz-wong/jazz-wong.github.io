Author's description:

White cursors are the default cursors for every Microsoft operating system. This set that I have created is pure white and all the 15 cursor role icons are bigger. This cursor set is suitable for use on any colored background including black and white. The "Busy" cursor has a black interior so that its properly visible on the screen. The "Precision Select" and "Text Select" cursors needs to have a colored background other than white to make them visible.

You can always tweak the colors of your operating systems to make these cursors visible.
